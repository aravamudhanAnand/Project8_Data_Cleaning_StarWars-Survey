In this project, we will analyze data on the Star Wars movies.</br>
While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. 
To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses.

The data has several columns, including:
<ul>
  <li>RespondentID - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)</li>
  <li>Gender - The respondent's gender</li>
  <li>Age - The respondent's age</li>
  <li>Household Income - The respondent's income</li>
  <li>Education - The respondent's education level</li>
  <li>Location (Census Region) - The respondent's location</li>
  <li>Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? - Has a Yes or No response</li>
  <li>Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - Has a Yes or No response</li>
</ul>
